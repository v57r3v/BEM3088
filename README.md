Assessment  feedback
Assessment   is an essential   part of   learning.   It’show we   benchmark your   understanding,   measure the development of your   key skills   and   recognise   achievement.   However,   assessment   is about   much   more than just   a grade. The   key   reason we   mark work   is to   provide you with feedback to support ongoing   learning.
Feedback   is an essential   part of this   process and   Iam   committed   to   providing   you   with   as   much   honest, open and constructive feedback as   I   can. This   feedback   can   take   a   number   of   formats;   it   maybe   verbal   or   written   feedback   from   me   as   your   course   tutor,   it   maybe   highlighting   how you   have   performed against the   relevant   marking   criteria or   it   maybe   feedback from your   peers.
Feedback,   in whatever form,   is   provided to   help you   understand what you   have done   well      and   highlight areas where you   might   improve.   It   is always given with   the   aim   of   supporting   your   learning journey.   If this feedback   is ever   unclear or you do   not   understand what   you         need to   do to   improve, you should ask   me.   Iam always   here   to   help   and   will   be   happy   to discuss this with you one-to-one.
Similarly, feedback should   never   be just one way!   If you   have   ideas or   would   like to   make   suggestions,   please do   not   hesitate to contact   me.   I welcome any   ideas   that   might   help   me   to   improve the support   I offer to   students.
Module   ILOs
As   part of our commitment to ensuring   that   each   Module   is   clearly   outlined   and   identifies   the   key skills you will develop during the   course,   we   define ‘Intended   Learning   Outcomes’   or   ILOs. These are split   into 3   areas:   Module-specific skills,   discipline   specific   skills   and   personal   aims.
For this   module, the   ILOs   have   been defined   as:
Module-specific
1.       Critically discuss organisational   design   principles,   and   the   different   types   of   organizational structures that support effective strategy   design   and execution.
2.       Evaluate   models that drive   innovation   and   facilitate   strategic   adaptation   and   sustained   long-term firm   performance.
3.       Evaluate the   significance of   managing   organisational   networks,   and   how   network dynamics   impact successful strategy   implementation.
Discipline specific
4.       Synthesize theory   and organisational   data   in   order   to   think   strategically   about   organisational design,   networks, and   innovation.
5.       Demonstrate awareness   of   emerging   trends,   tools,   and   practises   in   strategic   management.
Personal    Key aims
6.       Analyse and critically   evaluate   real-life   company   situations   and   business   cases.
It’s   important to   review and   understand these, as   not only   do they   highlight   what   you   will learn during this course and   how this will   support   your future   personal   and   profession   aims,   but   it also   hig代 写BEM3088 Advanced Strategic Management 2024-25C/C++
